# LOSH_Winter_Habitat

This is code used for modeling multi-scale, winter habitat selection by Loggerhead Shrikes.

We constructed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) in Program R 3.5.3 (R Core Team 2019) with the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015) to assess habitat selection by all shrikes combined and by each demographic group separately (females, males, HY/SY individuals, AHY/ASY individuals). The dependent variable for all models was the binomial point type: Used or Available. We first conducted pairwise correlation tests among all variables at all scales using the pairs function in R and a standard correlation cutoff value (r = 0.7; Dormann et. al. 2013). If two variables were >70% correlated, we removed one of the two variables, based on an evaluation of those variables’ biological significance and potential for measurement error. We then attempted to replicate the hierarchical, behavioral process of habitat selection by birds (McGarigal et al. 2016) by building models with variables from the broadest (500-m) to finest (perch level) scales. At each scale, we compared models using Akaike’s Information Criterion with small-sample correction (AICc) and considered all models ΔAICc ≤2 to be equivalent (Akaike 1974, Burnham and Anderson 1998). All models included the bird identity as a random intercept to account for multiple locations involving the same individuals. 

We followed an information-theoretic model selection process by first comparing all univariate and bivariate models including the 500-m land cover data variables and a null model. We then added all combinations of up to 2 more variables from the 250-m scale to each of the top models from the 500-m scale to create models that combined scales. We restricted each model to contain at most 2 variables from each scale because we were testing such a large suite of variables in order to limit the number of models built for comparison. We then compared these combined models to the top models from the 500-m scale, univariate and bivariate models from variables at the next finest scale (250-m), and the null model. This process was then repeated for the 100-m, 11-m, and 5-m scales, respectively. After narrowing down to the final suite of top models, we assessed the importance and directionality of habitat selection for variables included in these models by examining the sign and 85% confidence intervals (CIs) around β coefficients (Burnham and Anderson 2002; Arnold 2010). We considered a variable to be of importance if its 85% CI did not overlap zero for the highest-weighted model in which it first appeared. To evaluate potential habitat partitioning among demographic groups, we qualitatively compared models and variables of importance amongst sexes and age classes.
